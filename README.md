## MC Server Manager
Hey, I'm KryptonGamer and I'm learning to code even more in C # and getting started with WPF. Currently I have a minecraft 1.15.x server to play with my friends and over two weeks I have realized that I had to collect a lot of information so that my server was optimal, it would restart only even with crash and I could update the mods automatically without having to pass a file to my friends every time I inserted or removed a mod.

With MCSM what I want to achieve is that at least those people who need it, can run a server with the best arguments, have the server auto-restart (it even crashes or freezes) and their users can update their mods in real time .

Perhaps in the future I will release the project so that anyone can modify it to their liking
